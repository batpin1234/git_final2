00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,944
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

3
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:05,390
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God.</i>

4
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,798
<i>Creator of the ends of the earth.</i>

5
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,751
<i>He will not grow tired or wary.</i>

6
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,409
<i>And his understanding
no one can fathom.</i>

7
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,230
<i>He gives strength to the weary.</i>

8
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:24,062
<i>And increases the power to the weak.</i>

9
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,060
<i>Even you grow tired and weary.</i>

10
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,225
<i>And young man stumble and fall</i>

11
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,643
<i>But those who hope in the Lord.</i>

12
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:34,951
<i>Will renew their strength.</i>

13
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:39,579
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

14
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:40,955
<i>They will run</i>

15
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:42,338
<i>And not be weary.</i>

16
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:43,588
<i>They will walk.</i>

17
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,617
<i>And not be frightened.</i>

18
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,135
Desmond.

19
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,595
Hang on.

20
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,665
Hang on, Desmond.

21
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,037
We're gonna get you outta here.

22
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,310
Desmond.

23
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,021
Desmond.

24
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:16,060
What.

25
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:17,568
Wait up.

26
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,632
Catch up.

27
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,356
Wait up. I got
something to tell you.

28
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,570
What Hal?

29
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,187
Race you to the top.

30
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,531
Hey cheater.

31
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,144
See you later slowpoke.

32
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,404
Hey.

33
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:50,798
Wanna hand?

34
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,197
I got it.

35
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,517
Saved ya.

36
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,720
Ah, you don't. Quit it.

37
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,111
You quit it.

38
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:07,825
God sake.

39
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,043
Hey, get away from that ledge.

40
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,498
You damn fool kids.

41
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,409
You gonna break your neck.

42
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,439
It's them Doss kids.

43
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,397
Crazy as their old man.

44
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,337
They dug up the corner of Jack's remain.

45
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,270
Put him in the sidewalk.

46
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,655
You boys won't recognize it now.

47
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,434
Mind you I doubt
they'll recognize you.

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,232
They hardly know me
when I walked by.

49
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,049
It's like I died with you.

50
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,076
It's like we boys never existed.

51
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:18,727
Well that's all I
got for you today.

52
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,414
Block him with your
right Desmond.

53
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:43,258
Stop it.

54
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,431
Do you hear me.

55
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,125
What are they fighting about?

56
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:48,500
When did they ever
needed a reason.

57
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:49,664
Hey Tom do you

58
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,826
Why stop and save me
whipping them both.

59
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,427
This way I'd whip
the one that wins.

60
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,858
Tom.

61
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,490
No.

62
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,006
Oh God.

63
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,159
Tom.

64
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,331
Wake up.
Can you hear me?

65
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:06,901
What the hell did you done?

66
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,511
He can't hear me.

67
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:12,048
We'll get some ice.

68
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:16,990
You shift that basket.

69
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:18,131
I got it.

70
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,378
Is he breathing?

71
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:22,717
Hal?

72
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,605
Hal can you hear me?

73
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,201
Hal can you hear me?

74
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:38,483
Hal?

75
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,279
Come on.

76
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:41,894
Dear God help him.

77
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:43,405
Hal?

78
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,688
What do you think you doing?

79
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:14,825
I'm going to have to beat you now.
You know the rules.

80
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:17,968
You hear me Desmond?

81
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
Desmond!

82
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,487
Tom. Stop.

83
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,726
It's not going to teach the boy.
His violence enough already.

84
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,309
Like I find you go smothering and kiss him.

85
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,813
You tell him the world
is soft and gentle place.

86
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,381
Hal's gonna be okay.

87
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,328
Hey.

88
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:56,864
I could've killed him.

89
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:58,754
Yes, you could have.

90
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:02,018
Murder is the worst sin of all.

91
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,381
And to take another man's life.

92
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:07,232
That is the most egregious
sin in Lord's eye.

93
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,786
Nothing hurts His heart the most.

94
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,491
I hate him.

95
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,364
Mama.

96
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,473
Why does he hate us so much?

97
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,138
Oh he don't hate us.

98
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,833
He hates himself.

99
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:07,685
Sometimes.

100
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,772
Your daddy and I met the real him.

101
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,377
I wish you knew him like
I did before the war.

102
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,530
How do we sound Desmond?

103
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,802
Like a heavenly host angels, Mom.

104
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,293
Now you know it's a
sin to tell a lie.

105
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,951
Especially in this place.

106
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,744
Well I never said they
were singing angels.

107
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,834
What's going on out there, Desmond?

108
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:00,421
Go on. Get him out.
Get him out.

109
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,310
Drag him out.

110
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,224
Just tug.

111
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,090
I'll phone an ambulance.

112
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,253
No.
No time.

113
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,575
Joshua your pick up?

114
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:14,200
Quick.

115
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:15,122
Okay.

116
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:34,088
You gonna be fine, man.
You gonna be fine.

117
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:35,902
You in good hand.

118
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,617
What do we got here.

119
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:40,596
That's a severed artery.

120
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,823
- Get some sutures.
- Yes, doctor.

121
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,018
Put some pressure on it.

122
00:10:43,097 --> 00:10:44,285
Did you apply this tourniquet?

123
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,128
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:48,362
Nice work. You might've
save this boy's life.

125
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,207
You staying with us.
You'll be okay.

126
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:51,798
We can get that.

127
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,068
Stay with us.
You should be okay.

128
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:00,122
You feel okay?

129
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,169
Certainly doc.

130
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,899
Army physical is that way.
This is for giving blood.

131
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,182
Are you alright?

132
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,641
Oh no. That's not mine.

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm fine.

134
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,451
Thank you for asking though maam.

135
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,666
What do you need?

136
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,384
My belt.

137
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:38,659
I lend it to the boy
who had the accident.

138
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:41,628
My pants don't hold up
so good without it.

139
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,834
Well I dont' have your belt.

140
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:48,330
No. I know that maam. It's
out there with the boys still.

141
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:49,493
Okay.

142
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:52,707
I'm just here to take blood.

143
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,255
I'll give you mine.

144
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:56,848
Okay.

145
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,773
Go to that room over there.
Wait with the others.

146
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,154
I'll call you here.

147
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,337
That. That room.

148
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,037
You ever given blood before, Mr.

149
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:20,138
Doss.

150
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:24,219
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, maam this is my first time.

151
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,806
I always dream about
being a doctor but ahhh

152
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,441
Didn't get much school.

153
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,204
Might be a little dizzy when we're done.

154
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:45,177
Somebody picking you up?

155
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,893
No, maam.
I'm walking back.

156
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:49,637
Where do you live?

157
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,296
Fort Ham, Maam.

158
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,148
That's away.

159
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,934
Five or six miles.

160
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,544
I cut through the woods.

161
00:13:58,109 --> 00:13:59,109
Seven that way.

162
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,174
Must really like the woods.

163
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,387
Yes maam.
Sure do.

164
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,046
Okay.

165
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,311
Put some pressure here.

166
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:09,093
You okay?

167
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,639
Where are you going looking
all spruce and nice?

168
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,563
Met someone yesterday.

169
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,725
Nurse over at the hospital name Dorothy
Schutte and I'm gonna marry her.

170
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,468
Goodness, does she know that?

171
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,353
Well not yet but about to.

172
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,484
Do you have even spoken to a woman?

173
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,847
Other than the one that's not family.

174
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:31,988
Spoke to her.

175
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:36,394
In that case, come give
your brother a big hug.

176
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:38,849
Oh hell. Get your greasy paws off of me.

177
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,438
Wish me luck mama.

178
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,258
Good luck.

179
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,467
Next.

180
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,803
Grab a seat.

181
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,110
You ever been given blood before?

182
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,256
Yes maam I have.

183
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:30,639
You the belt man.

184
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,323
Desmond that's me.

185
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:35,470
Well Desmond we can't take
your blood two days in a row.

186
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,406
That's good.
Can we get mine back?

187
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:38,632
You what?

188
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,428
My blood I need it back.

189
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:44,233
It dont work like that.
We can't just give it back to you.

190
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:45,897
Well you got to.

191
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:49,840
Ever since you stuck me with that
needle my heart is beating up fast.

192
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:52,005
Every time I think about
you beat faster still.

193
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,215
I never heard that one before.

194
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,762
It's pretty corny.

195
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:58,989
It is.

196
00:15:59,317 --> 00:15:59,817
Yeah.

197
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:03,314
That's a shame. I've been
practicing that all night.

198
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:04,447
No good?

199
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,780
I didn't say that.

200
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:31,025
What's the difference between
an artery and a vein?

201
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,884
What are you talking about?

202
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:36,190
The boy's accident.

203
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,223
Arteries spurt blood.

204
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,358
And veins?

205
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,207
Bleed.

206
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,203
I think you need to
practice your boys and

207
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,255
girls dating talk at home
before you come out.

208
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,836
I probably do.

209
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,702
I give you a book if you that interested.

210
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,257
On dating?

211
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,110
On blood.

212
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,906
Another medical question perhaps?

213
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:20,221
No, I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

214
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,588
That's cause I'm
sitting in the dark.

215
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,036
No.

216
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:30,436
And you're beautiful.

217
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,236
Out of the way!

218
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,995
You need to watch
where you going.

219
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:15,212
I'm sorry I didn't
think you mind.

220
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:16,672
You didn't ask.

221
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,687
I thought you might've like it.

222
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:21,446
Well I might've if you asked.

223
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,506
You coming?

224
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:38,305
Shit!

225
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,229
Why didn't you say anything to us?

226
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,323
Cause you would've try and talk me out of
it and know what I'm doing is right.

227
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,640
And what about His commandment?

228
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,304
It's not killing in a war.

229
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,391
I would protected lots of boys
from our church from going.

230
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:14,040
There's a war
and they need men.

231
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,989
Working in a paper mill aren't
going to save this country.

232
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,420
Looks like a movie star.

233
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:29,897
Huh boy?

234
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:33,913
Nice uniform.

235
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:36,406
Good hat.

236
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:43,096
Reminds me how hard he getting in his look
in this uniform when we went to France.

237
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:46,378
Remember him Dorothy?

238
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:46,925
Don't Tom.

239
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
What?

240
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:53,780
I'm just saying how snappy
Hal looks in his uniform.

241
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,938
All you girls certainly
seems to think so.

242
00:19:57,185 --> 00:20:00,452
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

243
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:09,241
I just hope that when all hell get shot
it's through the front of his jacket.

244
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:13,303
Like a simple entry wound
not what you miss.

245
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,444
Already got hit in the back.
It blew most of his

246
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:19,874
guts and intestines out his
front awful everywhere.

247
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,755
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

248
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:34,152
It was lucky he was dead so he never
knew how awful his uniform looked.

249
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,001
Get out of my sight.

250
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,475
What are you park mountain guard.

251
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:45,577
Are you gonna help
me Desmond Doss?

252
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,239
Or you just gonna leave me stranded?

253
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:52,800
I'll help you.

254
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,276
But it's gonna cost you.

255
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:55,706
What?

256
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,183
A kiss.

257
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,649
That is pure blackmail.

258
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,533
Well yes maam it is but
that is still my condition.

259
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,222
As indeed.

260
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,238
I gonna hold you to it.

261
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:25,806
Hold on now.

262
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,344
You ain't gonna slap me
are you?

263
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,610
Cause I'll fall off I'm
gonna take you with me.

264
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,276
Kiss me and find out.

265
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:25,354
What?

266
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:28,097
I have to enlist.

267
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:32,716
I can't stay here while
all them go fight for me.

268
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:33,605
Yes, you can.

269
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,052
- You can stay here.
- Dorothy I have to.

270
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:36,450
I will be a medic.

271
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:39,044
I figure I'll be saving
people not killing.

272
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,630
I have to go to work and
don't want to be late.

273
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:50,612
Dorothy. Don't.

274
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,002
Dorothy. Dorothy.

275
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:58,031
So are you gonna ask me
to marry you or what?

276
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,726
I don't know you
still gonna hate me?

277
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,278
I wouldn't know you haven't ask.

278
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,990
Well I'm asking you.

279
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,487
With all my heart.
Will you marry me?

280
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,626
Then yes.

281
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:14,197
Yes I will.

282
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:24,816
When?

283
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,902
Soon as you get your first leave.

284
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:28,816
But I still don't like you at this moment.

285
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,578
Yeah.

286
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:31,789
Okay.

287
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:33,937
I love you.

288
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,050
Shhhh.

289
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:49,576
Mama say come see you here.

290
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:56,614
These three were my best friends.

291
00:24:58,388 --> 00:24:59,721
I grew up with them.

292
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:03,290
Got into trouble with them.
Chase girls with them.

293
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,526
I enlisted with them.

294
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,657
Then my friends are there.

295
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:14,563
Covered in dirt and grass eaten by worms.

296
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,669
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.

297
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,216
Daddy I signed up already.

298
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:28,193
I couldn't do otherwise pop.

299
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,771
- Everybody else is doing it.
- You ain't everybody else.

300
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,428
Everybody else jumps
in does thing quick

301
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,858
without thinking like
damn idiot fools we were.

302
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:46,166
You know that soldiers who live they
live cause they can do that. You can't!

303
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,229
You got to sit and think
and pray about everything.

304
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:53,356
Look at you.
You're doing it right now.

305
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,007
You won't be able to live
with yourself if you go.

306
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,109
No, I won't be able to live
with myself if I don't.

307
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,319
I'm going to be a medic.

308
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,033
That's going to be my way to serve.

309
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,111
There you go thinking it all out.

310
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:08,074
What you figure this war is
going to fit in with you?

311
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,192
Your ideas?

312
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,928
What I know I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.

313
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:16,733
It won't be hard.
It will be impossible.

314
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:18,965
You know whatever.

315
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,480
beliefs you had in your
crazy head now.

316
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:24,327
They don't ever play out
it don't work that way.

317
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:27,282
And if by certain I don't
know miracle chance you

318
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:30,267
survive you won't be
giving no thanks to God.

319
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,299
Break. Break. We all need some air.

320
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:41,337
C'mon fellas shake a leg. I'd understand
you got to say goodbye to mama.

321
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,679
C'mon.

322
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,544
Ladies please! Step away from the bus.

323
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:46,515
I almost forgot.

324
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:47,515
Do I need a crowbar.

325
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,554
Here.

326
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,653
I want you to have this.

327
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:52,014
It's mine.

328
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,552
You keep it right here.

329
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:57,506
Where I'll be.

330
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,166
I love you.

331
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:03,144
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed.

332
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,266
Gaze upon it in envy my friend.

333
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:07,879
You okay there?

334
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,410
You look lost.

335
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,053
Or you can sit right here.

336
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:12,684
Nice choice.

337
00:28:12,996 --> 00:28:15,396
It got views to the
mountain down to lake.

338
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:16,618
Randall Fuller.

339
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,149
Desmond Doss.

340
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,509
Call him 'Teach'.

341
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,394
You won't understand
a word he says.

342
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,454
That because no one
else here can read.

343
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:27,759
But testicles there belong to
a man calling himself 'Hollywood'.

344
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,817
They look like they
belong to a smaller guy.

345
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:32,112
You know testicles.

346
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,499
Oh hey.

347
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:36,028
I just got this shoes.

348
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,384
Hey ya.

349
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,276
Grease Nolan out of Redwood.
Where you from?

350
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:42,190
- Virginia.
- Will Billy huh?

351
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:44,105
You marry your first cousin?

352
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,470
Haha just joking.

353
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:47,302
Woah!

354
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:50,082
That Smitty over there
with Kirzinski's ass.

355
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,707
Like you were doing any
better chowder head.

356
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,388
Hey, I didn't want to embarrassed you.

357
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,215
Wal Kirzinski.
Nice to meet you.

358
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:56,552
Hey Ping Pong.

359
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,864
What you say your name was?

360
00:28:58,794 --> 00:28:59,794
Desmond Doss.

361
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:03,938
That Tex Lewis over there.

362
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,306
Thinks he some kind of cowboy.

363
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:06,522
And Vito Rinnelli.

364
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,798
Now he maybe small
but he is a bulldog.

365
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,086
- Hi how you doing?
- Desmond.

366
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:14,089
This handsome guy right
here is Lucky Ford.

367
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:14,552
Hey.

368
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,864
That's Walker and Pinnick over there.
Pretending they're card shufflers.

369
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,091
Pipe down greasy alright.

370
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,506
Unless you want to put
money where your mouth is.

371
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:23,725
Oh hey.

372
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:27,159
Good Book right?

373
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,498
- Right.
- I think ahh

374
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:31,254
I think Lucky's got a good book,
right Lucky?

375
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:32,020
It's a good read.

376
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:35,715
Attention!

377
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:36,855
Ow!

378
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,324
Line up. Move it.

379
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:40,211
Let's go.
Move it. Move it.

380
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:14,856
You're a strange looking individual
if you don't mind me saying so Private?

381
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,668
Name?

382
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:17,012
Andy Walker.

383
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:18,646
How long have you been dead son?

384
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:19,935
Sir?

385
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:20,967
I am not sir.

386
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,732
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.

387
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,049
Sir you say for useless people.

388
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:29,698
The name is Ghoul you say.

389
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:30,565
Walker.

390
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:31,643
Sergeant.

391
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:32,745
It is.

392
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:33,792
Yes, Sergeant.

393
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,910
There's something off with
your presentation Private.

394
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:53,818
Can't place it.

395
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,013
Is it your hair?

396
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,399
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

397
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,297
I have a knife in
my foot Sergeant.

398
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:05,312
Oh yes. Of course.
That's it the knife.

399
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:07,272
What is your name soldier?

400
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:08,453
Smitty Riker.

401
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:10,554
No. Your name is Private Idiot.

402
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,703
You know why?

403
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:12,742
Cause I have a knife in my foot.

404
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:14,797
Who place the knife there Private?

405
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,601
It was an accident Sergeant.
I was playing stretch.

406
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:19,953
I'm hardened by the knowledge you
did not placed it there with intention.

407
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,937
Who threw the knife?

408
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,611
I did Sergeant.

409
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,101
Private Kirzinski.

410
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,605
You're part Indian.

411
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:29,698
What tribe do you belong, son?

412
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:31,155
Don't know I'm polish.

413
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,985
Wrong.

414
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,446
I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

415
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,277
- No Sir.
- Are you contradicting me?

416
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:37,788
You son of a bitch.

417
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:38,828
No sergeant.

418
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,482
Let me see your Indian war cry son.

419
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:41,874
I don't.

420
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:48,533
What is your animal spirit?

421
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,627
- Are you a Garter snake?
- No Sergeant.

422
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:52,323
- Are you a chipmunk?
- No, sergeant.

423
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:55,096
- Are you a dancing reindeer?
- No sergeant.

424
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:57,166
- Are you contradicting me Private?
- No sergeant.

425
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:58,191
Good.

426
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:01,300
Then I shall henceforth call you Chief.

427
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:03,932
As a sign of great respect to your people.

428
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,625
Thank you, sergeant.

429
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:10,344
Are you grinning at me boy
or is that your natural state?

430
00:32:10,423 --> 00:32:11,094
No Sergeant.

431
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,102
Name private.

432
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,275
Desmond Doss.

433
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:16,428
I have seen stocks of corn
with better physiques.

434
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:18,803
Makes you wanna pull an ear off Private.

435
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:20,397
Can you carry your weight?

436
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:21,256
Yes Sergeant.

437
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,327
Should be easy for you then.

438
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:24,582
Corporal.

439
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:26,683
Make sure you keep this
man away from strong winds.

440
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:27,863
Yes, Sergeant.

441
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,242
- Private idiot.
- Yes Sergeant.

442
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:33,395
Raise your foot.

443
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:34,532
Higher.

444
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,048
Everyone outside now.

445
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,375
Move it.

446
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,961
I said move it.

447
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,430
I'm just getting my uniform Sarge.

448
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,125
Did I asked him to Corporal?

449
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,375
No memory of it Sarge.

450
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:50,857
I believe any man who take such
pride in his natural naked state.

451
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,466
Will surely enjoy the
brisk of the outdoors.

452
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,576
Now move your private, Private Parts.

453
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,558
Move it.

454
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,542
You son of an exhibitionist.

455
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm gonna teach you how
to tie a bowline knot.

456
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:08,203
So you can get your sorry
asses down from a height.

457
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:09,562
So I make them kicked 'em.

458
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:11,539
Create a loop.

459
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,725
This is the rabbit hole.

460
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,593
The rabbit comes out of his hole.

461
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,095
Runs around the tree.

462
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:18,328
Goes back into the hole.

463
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,406
Alright.

464
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,008
Let's go.

465
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:25,371
Very good Texas.

466
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:26,929
Keep struggling Teach.

467
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:30,257
Have you ever rope a goat, Hollywood?

468
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:31,618
No Sarge.

469
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:33,718
- Have you ever looked into a goat's eye.
- No sarge.

470
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:35,681
Good. That would be unnatural.

471
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,413
You know if you don't breath you'll die.

472
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,397
Good Private Idiot.

473
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:49,342
Congratulations Greaseball, you just
fell fifty feet and broke your neck.

474
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:51,436
Brilliant.

475
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,155
Private Vito Rinnelli.

476
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:55,209
You strangle yourself numb nuts.

477
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:56,905
Are you a fan of Benilli?

478
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,200
No Sergeant.

479
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,630
You're American you'd be taller.

480
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,161
What do we got here Doss?

481
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:08,736
One for each titty

482
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,313
You're tying a bowline boy.

483
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:13,035
Not building a bra.

484
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,596
- What is so funny Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you Sergeant.

485
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,466
Come on.

486
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:23,151
Come on ladies.
Pick it up.

487
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:25,590
Move it. Move it.
I wanna see some fire here.

488
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:26,705
A little hustle.

489
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,050
Show me something.

490
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,834
Run like you need it.
Down. Down. Down.

491
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,337
Let's go trash town boys.

492
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:39,027
Move. Move. Move.
I wanna see you got it.

493
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,827
Let's go.
Get in. Get in. Get in.

494
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:44,312
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

495
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,518
I bet you're enjoying
this naked degenerate.

496
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:50,738
Let's go.
Hustle. Hustle. Hustle.

497
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:51,825
Move.

498
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:55,115
Let's go. What are we waiting on.
Let's go.

499
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:56,465
Move your ass.

500
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,944
Get the wood. Get the wall.
Don't kiss quitters.

501
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,720
Drive. Drive.

502
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,087
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

503
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,602
What the hell is wrong with you?
No one says take a rest.

504
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,452
Move your asses to the finish line.
Move.

505
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,538
Hustle. Hustle.

506
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:22,117
Get your asses across damn line.

507
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:25,774
Aye, nice work Doss.

508
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,826
This is a personal gift
from the United States

509
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:36,672
government to each
and everyone of you.

510
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:39,507
Standard issue U.S. rifle.

511
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:40,938
Caliber 30.

512
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,110
M1

513
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,313
A clipboard.

514
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,972
Shoulder fired semi
automatic weapon designed

515
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,844
to bring death and
destruction to the enemy.

516
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,820
This is to be your lover.

517
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,273
Your mistress.

518
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,711
Your concubine.

519
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,063
Perhaps.

520
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,375
The only thing in life
you ever truly love.

521
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,850
Built with light stands.

522
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,375
Grab a girl.

523
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:06,496
Don't point your gun forward.
I do not want to be shot today.

524
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:09,135
No matter how much
you are tempted.

525
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,306
Place the weapon by your side.

526
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,306
Pay attention.

527
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:24,041
Problem private corn stock?

528
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,701
Is there not one in your size?

529
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:27,834
Or is it the color that is the issue?

530
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:29,029
No Sarge.

531
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:34,271
I was told I don't have
to carry a weapon.

532
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:38,293
Come again step forward Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

533
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:45,776
Well I'm sorry Sergeant.

534
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,908
I can't touch a gun.

535
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,877
What exactly is the problem?

536
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,471
No problem just a mistake.

537
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:59,213
- I told the army when I joined up.
- It's impossible.

538
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,253
You know why it's not possible, Private?

539
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:03,277
No, Sir.

540
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:05,808
Cause the United States
Army do not make mistakes.

541
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,508
There's a problem.

542
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:10,131
You must be that problem.

543
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,930
I was never supposed to be
sent to a rifle company.

544
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:14,915
He's a CO sir.

545
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,563
You're a conscientious objector.

546
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,640
- And you joined the army.
- Well no sir.

547
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,941
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

548
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:33,953
- You just screwing with me Doss.
- No. No sir. I volunteered.

549
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:39,655
I got no problem with wearing my uniform.
Saluting the flag and doing my duty.

550
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:43,561
It's just carrying a gun
and taking a human life.

551
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,889
You don't kill. That's all.

552
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,221
Yes sir. That's all.

553
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,547
You know quite a bit of
killing does occur in a war.

554
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:52,288
Yes, sir.

555
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,769
I mean that is the
essential nature of war.

556
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:55,824
Yes sir.

557
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:56,949
Alright.

558
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:00,989
You have any other requirements
for the United States army.

559
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:03,203
Is there anything else that
we can do to ensure that

560
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,966
you're comfortable with
your stay here with us?

561
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:07,629
He doesn't wanna work on Saturday, sir.

562
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:11,968
Well Saturday is. I'm a
Seventh Day Adventist so.

563
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:16,253
Saturday is my sabbath so I'm
not allowed to work then.

564
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:18,667
I don't think that poses a problem.
Do you sergeant?

565
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,508
We should simply ask the
enemy not to invade on a Sabbath

566
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:24,144
cause Private Doss
here is a prayer.

567
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,820
Alright. Now we got that clear.

568
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:31,369
Now let me tell you my requirements.
They're not as

569
00:38:31,415 --> 00:38:34,589
complicated as yours.
They are very simple.

570
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,721
As long as you're in this
company under my command.

571
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,800
You're gonna obey my orders.
Period.

572
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:46,334
If you can't do it here. I can't
trust you to do it in the battle.

573
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:53,762
I'm putting you in for Section 8.
Psychiatric discharge.

574
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:56,177
Dismiss.

575
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:57,792
Gentlemen.

576
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:01,710
I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.

577
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:02,941
Apparently.

578
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:05,729
Private Doss does not
believe in violence.

579
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:07,643
He does not practice violence.

580
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,018
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

581
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:12,776
You see Private Doss

582
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,383
is a conscientious objector.

583
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:17,475
So I plead with you.

584
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,748
Do not look to him to save
you on a battlefield.

585
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:27,464
Because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

586
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:30,301
- Sarge, that's not true, sarge.
- Private as you were.

587
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:37,382
I realize some of you might have
strong feelings about this.

588
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,289
It is what we men fight for.

589
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:41,661
To defend our rights.

590
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,948
To protect our women and children.

591
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:46,980
Even if Private Doss's belief

592
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:50,555
might cause women and children to die.

593
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,524
So I will expect every
one in this company

594
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:57,376
to give Private Doss the full
measure of respect he is due.

595
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,235
For the short time he will be with us.

596
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:02,434
Am I clear?

597
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:04,294
Yes, sergeant.

598
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:15,114
What you got here Daisy?

599
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:22,229
- You know what that is?
- Just seems kind of small.

600
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,175
It's half-the-Bible
for half-the-man.

601
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:25,510
Pete's sake, Smitty give
him back his Bible.

602
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,386
I don't remember
speaking with you.

603
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:33,159
So how come you don't fight?

604
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,370
Do you think you better than us?

605
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:37,178
No.

606
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:39,248
Well, what if you're attacked.

607
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Woah.

608
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,136
Did you like that?

609
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:48,122
Bible says to turn your other cheekbone.

610
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:52,899
You see I don't think this is a
question of religion, fellas.

611
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:54,805
I think this is cowardice.

612
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,713
Plain and simple.

613
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:58,134
You alright Doss?

614
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:00,961
You chickenshit that it?

615
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:03,973
Go on.

616
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:05,871
Take a poke.

617
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,466
Okay I'm gonna give a free shot.

618
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:11,072
Right there.

619
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:13,509
Hit me Doss.

620
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:14,822
Go on.

621
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:18,112
No?

622
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,041
- What is this?
- Give me that.

623
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,533
This is fine looking broad.

624
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
- Wooooh.
- Nice.

625
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,584
Now this would be the kind of broad.

626
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,231
That deserve a real man.

627
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:39,787
Give me that back.

628
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:41,735
Please.

629
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:44,438
Please.

630
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,102
Please give it back, Smitty.

631
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:50,124
Please give it back, Smitty.

632
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
Do you hear voices Desmond?

633
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:06,685
No, Sir.

634
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:10,815
I understand that God talks to you.
Is that right?

635
00:42:11,185 --> 00:42:12,880
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

636
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:15,605
Then how you feel most people regard you

637
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,458
Crazy person.

638
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,810
I'm different I know that. But

639
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:24,661
I'm not gonna pretend to
be something I'm not.

640
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:25,693
I am what I am.

641
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:27,185
Sounds lonely.

642
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:29,427
You lonely?

643
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:36,141
So you don't hear voices.

644
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:37,201
No, sir.

645
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:38,849
I pray to God and I

646
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:42,981
like to think He hears me but
it ain't a conversation.

647
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,094
Like how I won't gonna pretend we
have right now.

648
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:47,516
Pretending, private?

649
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:49,242
Yes, sir. I know what
you really wanna do is

650
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:52,119
is give me a section 8 draw
me out of the army. But

651
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:53,439
I'm not.

652
00:42:53,924 --> 00:42:54,759
Up above.

653
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,033
I just simply believe
what I believe.

654
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,267
Well I'm trying to understand.

655
00:43:00,572 --> 00:43:05,400
Alright? Was it God who told
you not to pick up a rifle?

656
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,705
God says not to kill.

657
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,039
That one of His most
important commandments.

658
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:13,619
Most people take that to
only don't commit murder.

659
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:17,243
War is completely different
set of circumstances.

660
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:20,798
Jesus said a new commandment
I give them to you.

661
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:23,857
That you love one another.

662
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,187
Just as I love you.

663
00:43:25,248 --> 00:43:29,027
This is Satan himself we're fighting.
Sure as

664
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:30,918
good Christian you can see that.

665
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:33,582
I can see that sir and
that is why I joined up.

666
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,947
But I'm sorry I will not bear arms.

667
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:42,383
His religious view is
certainly unique but they

668
00:43:42,408 --> 00:43:45,494
do not constitute ground
for Section 8 discharge.

669
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,023
How am I suppose to maintain
discipline with a man like that in my unit?

670
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:50,102
I don't know.

671
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:52,810
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector.

672
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:55,594
He must be allowed to work
as combat medic provided

673
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,217
he qualifies in all other
areas in his training.

674
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:02,041
Perhaps we could help
make alleviate his idea.

675
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:06,291
Yeah you restrict him to barracks in KP.

676
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:09,026
He throws God at you.
You throw hell right at him.

677
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:10,142
I want him gone.

678
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:29,027
Doss your area is in disgrace.

679
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:30,825
It's a pig stock.

680
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,694
- Something funny Ryker?
- No sarge.

681
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:36,545
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No sarge.

682
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:39,889
What you men fail to recognize

683
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:43,531
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member.

684
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,452
I hope you learned that lesson.

685
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,921
There will be no passes this weekend.

686
00:44:49,382 --> 00:44:50,849
You all will be on KP.

687
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:55,203
Right now everybody on full
gear for 20-mile hike.

688
00:44:55,477 --> 00:44:56,477
Let's go.

689
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:57,781
Let's go.

690
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:03,187
Get your heads right.

691
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,091
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

692
00:45:06,116 --> 00:45:09,084
Makes me sick seeing you
feel sorry for yourself.

693
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,481
You dogs don't know
what tired is.

694
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:13,736
We gonna keep going till I drop.

695
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:17,669
Come on guys.

696
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:24,376
Hey knock it. Knock it off.

697
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,960
Trying to sleep here.

698
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,229
Get off me.
Get off.

699
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,099
Why the hell you still here?

700
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,409
- Ten-hut.
- As you were.

701
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,359
Where's Doss?

702
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,248
This isn't good for you buddy.

703
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,734
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

704
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:33,796
It's not about what you joined up for.

705
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:37,071
About the lives of
every men in here.

706
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:39,852
And yours son.

707
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:42,603
It's time you quit this.

708
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:46,250
Finish getting dress and
I'll walk you down.

709
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,524
It's okay Doss.

710
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:57,779
There's no shame in this.

711
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:15,085
Let's go.

712
00:47:16,312 --> 00:47:21,272
I got an extra guard duty.
Today and I'm on KP this morning. So

713
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,207
I can't.

714
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,516
Alright Doss.

715
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:36,297
Private Doss.

716
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,898
Can you identify the men that beat you?

717
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,319
No sarge.

718
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:50,037
Are you saying that you
don't know who attack you?

719
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:53,679
I never said I was attacked sarge.

720
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,140
What the hell are you saying Doss?

721
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:00,016
You bruised half your body sleeping.

722
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:03,834
I sleep pretty hard.

723
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,453
Planning on getting wet this
week make sure you put on a hat.

724
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:15,498
I don't want anyone back piss in cream.

725
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,178
What you don't want to
offer your coffee sarge.

726
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,586
How about a shot right now Smitty?

727
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,897
Speaking from experience sarge.

728
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,115
You have to ask your mom
about that greaseball.

729
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:31,853
At ease.

730
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:37,656
Private Doss.

731
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:40,585
I'm afraid I can't authorize your pass.

732
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:43,620
This is a furlough for men who
had pass the basic training.

733
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:49,238
Respectfully sir I have.

734
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,069
I put in for this
furlough three weeks ago.

735
00:48:53,186 --> 00:48:55,444
I'm getting married
this afternoon.

736
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:58,119
It says you're not
rifle-qualified.

737
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,651
Well I'm not required to carry a rifle, sir.

738
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:02,894
Colonel Colonel Stelzer he he...

739
00:49:02,924 --> 00:49:05,433
Colonel Stelzer stipulation was

740
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:08,525
Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic.

741
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:13,064
Provided he qualifies in all
other areas of his training.

742
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:16,174
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, private.

743
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,174
Pretty clear.

744
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:23,946
Show me you know how
to handle a rifle.

745
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:26,384
And I'll sign your furlough.

746
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:27,611
Corporal Cannon.

747
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,290
Hand private Doss your firearm.

748
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,170
I won't touch a rifle, sir.

749
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,381
I'm not asking you private.

750
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:47,123
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

751
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,893
For God's sake Doss.

752
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:53,447
You stop this nonsense and quit.

753
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,303
Refuse.

754
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:59,085
And I will have no recourse
but to court martial you.

755
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:02,811
And you will spend the duration
of the war in military prison.

756
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:06,766
I can't, sir.

757
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:22,047
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

758
00:50:23,623 --> 00:50:25,623
I think it's been long enough.

759
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:28,080
I'm so very sorry.

760
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:31,167
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

761
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,864
Some men might.

762
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,372
Not my Desmond.

763
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:12,603
You probably thinking I'm
a really son of a bitch.

764
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:16,699
Who cares only about
regulations and not his men.

765
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:20,549
May I.

766
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,140
I believe in this Book as much as any men.

767
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,540
Just like any men.

768
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:33,040
I wrestled with my conscience.

769
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:37,265
But what do you do when everything you
value in this world is under attacked.

770
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,086
I don't know, sir.

771
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:43,545
I ain't got answer to question that big.

772
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:47,594
But I also feel like my
values are under attacked.

773
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,238
I don't know why.

774
00:51:49,897 --> 00:51:52,974
I don't give a rat-ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

775
00:51:53,842 --> 00:51:57,099
If one of them attacks you and some
wounded soldiers. What are you gonna do?

776
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,497
Hit him with your Bible?

777
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,252
I'm prepare to give my life for my men.

778
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:05,104
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

779
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,018
Look.

780
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:10,409
I'm only here because I don't wanna see
you rotting in a prison cell.

781
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Plead guilty.

782
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:15,456
Put yourself at the mercy of the court.
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

783
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:21,789
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

784
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,549
If I can't convince
you maybe she can.

785
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:36,547
They wouldn't let me call you.

786
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:40,440
I know it wasn't your making.

787
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:45,556
What did they done to you?

788
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,508
It's okay I'm alright.

789
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:51,807
Just a couple of rounds
with a wall and lost.

790
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,876
They're saying you could
go to prison Desmond.

791
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:57,377
It'll never worth.

792
00:52:58,588 --> 00:52:59,962
There must be some other way.

793
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:02,157
I don't know what that could be.

794
00:53:02,455 --> 00:53:04,545
I done everything they'd asked
me except this one thing.

795
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,265
They've been treating me like a
criminal just cause I won't kill.

796
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,281
You tried.

797
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,608
Nobody can say you didn't.

798
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,670
But who you gonna save in prison?

799
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:16,838
Probably nobody.

800
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:19,479
Then why can't you just pick up the
stupid gun and wave it around.

801
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:22,049
You don't have to use it.
Just made it half-way.

802
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,234
I can't do that.

803
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:26,790
Yes, you can. It's just pride.

804
00:53:26,815 --> 00:53:27,619
Pride and stubbornness.

805
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,510
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

806
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:44,330
I've been proudfull.

807
00:53:46,548 --> 00:53:47,814
Maybe I'm proudful.

808
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:54,963
But I don't know how I'm
gonna live with myself

809
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:57,492
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

810
00:53:58,226 --> 00:54:00,826
Watching us how you could live with me.

811
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,178
I wanna be a man and I
wanna be in your eyes.

812
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:14,131
I fell in love with you.

813
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,427
Because you weren't like anyone else.

814
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:20,643
And you didn't try to be.

815
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:27,663
Do not think for one moment
that you'll disappoint me.

816
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:31,864
I will love you.

817
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,194
No matter what.

818
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,649
I don't know what he's gonna do.

819
00:54:48,946 --> 00:54:50,546
He loses no matter what.

820
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:54,765
They want him to plead guilty but
then it'll get him dishonorable discharge.

821
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:58,101
Otherwise he fights them he
will for sure go to prison.

822
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,390
Either way they'll call him a coward and
I don't see how he can live with that.

823
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,633
Thank you Dorothy.

824
00:55:06,985 --> 00:55:08,718
If you get to talk to him.

825
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,953
Tell him that we love him and that we'll
pray for him and we'll pray for both of you.

826
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:15,016
I will.

827
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:16,516
Bye-bye.

828
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:33,077
Of course I'm out of my mind.

829
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,338
What do you think I am.
I'm out of my mind.

830
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,177
Will you leave this room.

831
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,190
Don't Tom. Put it down.

832
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:40,934
Get away from me woman.

833
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:13,231
May I help you sir?

834
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:16,026
I wish to speak to Brigadier
General Musgrove.

835
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:19,774
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

836
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:30,722
If you would kinda tell me Corporal Thomas
Doss would've appreciate a brief word.

837
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:33,731
He is in a very important meeting.

838
00:56:34,581 --> 00:56:38,651
I fought with him in France at
Belleau Wood. He was my Captain.

839
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:44,738
Please maam. It's most vital.

840
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:03,780
Be over in a minute.

841
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:07,263
You'll be home safe and sound
like nothing ever happened.

842
00:58:00,372 --> 00:58:02,591
This is a hearing in the
matter of Private Doss.

843
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:06,348
The charge is disobeying a series of
direct orders from his commanding officer.

844
00:58:06,419 --> 00:58:07,953
How says the defendant?

845
00:58:09,893 --> 00:58:14,257
Private Doss wishes to
enter a not guilty plea.

846
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:16,733
Is that so Private? I
thought this was agreed.

847
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:19,093
You want to enter some
sort of plea bargain.

848
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,583
- Yes, sir. But I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

849
00:58:23,592 --> 00:58:25,998
You wish to proceed
to a court martial.

850
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:28,123
Yes, sir.

851
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:30,713
Your on your head then Private.

852
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:32,850
Proceed.

853
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:37,087
Your honor.

854
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:38,766
Private Doss.

855
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:42,430
Wave his morality like it's
some kind of badge of honor.

856
00:58:42,516 --> 00:58:44,049
He flaunts his contempt.

857
00:58:44,071 --> 00:58:47,445
By directly disobeying a series of direct
order from his commanding officer.

858
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:51,912
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against evil.

859
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,327
- You okay?
- Yes.

860
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,186
- They still deliberating?
- Yes, sir.

861
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,417
Okay you go take this in there.

862
00:59:01,428 --> 00:59:03,545
I can't. It's strictly
military personnel.

863
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:06,051
Well you get one of
them to take it in.

864
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,381
They ain't no help. They're
fixing to burying him.

865
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:12,107
There's only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

866
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,498
Do you deny disobeying Colonel
Sangston's direct orders?

867
00:59:19,214 --> 00:59:21,042
Well. Do you private?

868
00:59:26,886 --> 00:59:27,925
No, sir. I don't.

869
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,751
Why are you contesting it, then?

870
00:59:29,806 --> 00:59:32,694
Why is it so important to
you, given your refusal to even

871
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,471
touch a weapon to
serve in a combat unit?

872
00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:39,822
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

873
00:59:41,315 --> 00:59:44,463
Everyone I knew was on fire
to join up, including me.

874
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,959
There were two men in my hometown

875
00:59:51,602 --> 00:59:55,406
Declared 4-F unfit, they killed
themselves cause they couldn't serve.

876
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:01,374
Why, I had a job in a
defense plant.

877
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:04,165
I could've taken a deferment,
but that ain't right.

878
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,783
It isn't right that other
men should fight and die

879
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:13,942
that I would just be sitting at home safe.
I need this, sir.

880
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:19,051
I got the energy and the
passion to serve as a medic,

881
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:25,736
right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

882
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:30,257
while everybody else is taking
life, I'm going to be saving it.

883
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,691
With the world so set on
tearing itself apart,

884
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,611
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

885
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,351
to wanna put a little bit
of it back together.

886
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,382
Sorry sir, nobody is allowed in.

887
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:46,804
No. You don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

888
01:00:46,828 --> 01:00:49,161
- I understand sir. Nobody is allowed
- I have information.

889
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,765
Well, the sentiments
expressed are laudable.

890
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,798
The effects of the charge
is incontestable so

891
01:00:56,595 --> 01:00:58,995
What the hell is going on out there?

892
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,923
Let him go.

893
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,942
That's the Great War uniform.

894
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:15,513
It is, sir.

895
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,332
Sir, I need to show you this.

896
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:18,770
With respect, sir.

897
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:21,114
You are no longer a
member of the military.

898
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:23,145
You unable to attend this meeting.
I'm sorry.

899
01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:25,745
Is that truly the way it works?

900
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,737
You fight for your country

901
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:32,088
You lose so much ever dear to you.
And then you're done with?

902
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:34,769
Uniform's forgotten. You have no voice?

903
01:01:35,397 --> 01:01:36,464
You were enlist?

904
01:01:36,718 --> 01:01:38,545
I was sir Belleau Wood.

905
01:01:38,937 --> 01:01:41,374
Twice decorated. I see it sir.

906
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:44,264
I take it you're the father.

907
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:46,952
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

908
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:50,099
Then as former military man.
You know there are laws here.

909
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:53,717
Sir, I know the law. I am. I know my
son is protected by those laws.

910
01:01:53,748 --> 01:01:55,497
They are framed in our constitution.

911
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:57,630
And I believe in them as he does.

912
01:01:57,998 --> 01:02:00,466
That's why I went and
fought to protect them.

913
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,861
It's what I thought I was
doing because if it wasn't for

914
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:07,920
that then I have no idea what the
hell I was doing there, sir.

915
01:02:09,803 --> 01:02:11,403
Thank you Corporal Doss.

916
01:02:14,076 --> 01:02:15,609
Let me have the letter.

917
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:24,379
You must go.

918
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:42,149
The defendant's rights as
a conscientious objector

919
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:44,155
are protected by an Act of Congress.

920
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:46,890
And he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

921
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:53,005
That includes in this case his
disobeying orders to bear arm.

922
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:57,326
Signed Bridgadier General Musgrove. War
Services Commander, Washington DC.

923
01:02:58,068 --> 01:02:58,833
Colonel.

924
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:05,405
I withdraw the charges.

925
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:07,358
Then this case is dismissed.

926
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,853
Private Doss you are free to
run into the hell fire of

927
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:14,018
battle without a single
weapon to protect yourself.

928
01:03:15,247 --> 01:03:17,047
You may resume your duties.

929
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,044
Begin training as a combat medic.

930
01:03:25,465 --> 01:03:26,865
- Where is he?
- Gone.

931
01:03:26,872 --> 01:03:30,301
Straight after. I begged him to stay.
I told him he want the same.

932
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:33,992
When you get home you
tell him that I love him.

933
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:35,016
Okay.

934
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,697
You better come home to me.

935
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:33,420
♫ Uncle Sam is smiling.
Peaceful as a child. ♫

936
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:34,471
♫  But never get him rowdy. ♫

937
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,197
Cut it out, Tom.

938
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:37,221
So now you wanna play?

939
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:39,385
C'mon pipe down.
Shut up man.

940
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,668
Put a sock in it boy. You save the
choral for when we get there.

941
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:46,259
Your driver is here.

942
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:50,475
Give 'em room.

943
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,100
- Clear.
- Clear blue sky.

944
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:41,688
96th.

945
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,665
What's left of 'em.

946
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,750
These are the guys who replaced them.

947
01:06:17,615 --> 01:06:19,482
Seems good to me.
It's cool.

948
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,295
All clear sarge.

949
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:41,362
Captain Glover.

950
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:45,314
Lieutenant Manville. 96th.

951
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:47,614
We've been assigned to you, sir.

952
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:48,833
Okay.

953
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:51,552
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

954
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,161
- This is Sergeant Howell.
- Good to meet you sir.

955
01:06:54,224 --> 01:06:55,496
Who's Doss?

956
01:06:56,872 --> 01:06:57,872
Over there.

957
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:01,886
You Doss?

958
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:05,770
Irv Schecter

959
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,489
You and me and peach here.

960
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,825
About the only medics we
got left in this area. So

961
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:20,097
I guess we're going to
be working together.

962
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:21,984
You just come off the line?

963
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,009
What's it like?

964
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,128
I said what's it like?

965
01:07:30,627 --> 01:07:31,627
Hacksaw?

966
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,299
We caught it about six times.

967
01:07:35,432 --> 01:07:37,299
Six times they threw us off.

968
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:44,353
Last time wasn't anything
left for something to fix.

969
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:47,703
They're animals.

970
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:51,368
Stinking animals.

971
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:54,614
Nips don't care if they live or die.

972
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:56,784
They wanna die.

973
01:07:56,901 --> 01:07:58,501
They keep coming at you.

974
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:00,748
They never gonna give up.

975
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:03,276
Never.

976
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
Hey buddy.

977
01:08:10,394 --> 01:08:12,621
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

978
01:08:13,735 --> 01:08:15,789
Lose all your red cross markings.

979
01:08:16,766 --> 01:08:19,071
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

980
01:08:19,907 --> 01:08:21,640
That white's a bull's-eye.

981
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:24,743
Here I got you a new helmet.

982
01:08:25,892 --> 01:08:27,384
One-size-fits-all.

983
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:37,031
That's our objective.

984
01:08:37,225 --> 01:08:38,225
Hacksaw Ridge.

985
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:41,451
We take it.
Maybe we get Okinawa.

986
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:44,988
We get Okinawa.
We take Japan.

987
01:08:45,684 --> 01:08:46,534
Take a breather.

988
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:48,925
Our pals in the Navy are
gonna soften them up for us.

989
01:09:16,092 --> 01:09:18,025
Nobody can survive that shit.

990
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,717
Oh, but they can.

991
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,830
Lieutenant.

992
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,174
This bunkers here. Here and here.
Is that accurate?

993
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:47,910
Yes, sir.
[Nauseous]

994
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:59,509
Yes, sir. Maybe they are gonna look
from the back but that's all.

995
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:03,767
It's all different.
Up there.

996
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:05,394
[All here accounted.]

997
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:07,888
Gents.

998
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:10,279
Move out!

999
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:37,081
It's blood.

1000
01:10:37,245 --> 01:10:38,245
No shit.

1001
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,070
We're not in Kansas
anymore Dorothy.

1002
01:10:44,819 --> 01:10:46,162
Keep climbing.

1003
01:10:56,677 --> 01:10:58,810
Here. Come on give me your hand.

1004
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:19,983
Make way.

1005
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,983
Ralph, get this to Jessop.

1006
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,325
Incoming!

1007
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:19,739
Get down!

1008
01:13:23,277 --> 01:13:24,277
Get down!

1009
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:38,411
Where the hell are they?!!!

1010
01:13:38,463 --> 01:13:39,729
I can't see them!!!

1011
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:43,585
Where the fuck?!!!

1012
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:48,484
Medic!

1013
01:13:49,554 --> 01:13:50,554
Over here!

1014
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,924
Put your hand right here.

1015
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,694
Put your hand on that gut.

1016
01:13:57,457 --> 01:14:00,918
Come on. We're gonna
get you under cover.

1017
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:20,122
Keep moving forward.

1018
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:30,948
Can't see anything.

1019
01:14:31,306 --> 01:14:32,306
It's that one.

1020
01:14:32,345 --> 01:14:33,878
I dunno where to shoot.

1021
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,108
Alright let's go.

1022
01:14:44,883 --> 01:14:45,883
Dino.

1023
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,130
Oh shit!

1024
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:01,605
Doss, Dino's down.

1025
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:02,725
I'm coming.

1026
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:19,397
Get out of the way!

1027
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,750
You hurt?

1028
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:53,679
I'm fine.

1029
01:16:11,874 --> 01:16:13,141
Come on! I got you.

1030
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:14,267
Breath.

1031
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:18,603
Just breath.

1032
01:16:19,173 --> 01:16:20,173
Breath.

1033
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:21,205
It's okay.

1034
01:16:23,228 --> 01:16:24,228
Just breath.

1035
01:16:24,322 --> 01:16:25,322
Just breath.

1036
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,221
I got you.

1037
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:32,635
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:35,443
Give him a shot of morphine
and move on.

1039
01:16:36,451 --> 01:16:37,606
He's not gonna last a day.

1040
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:39,630
Please. Please Doss.
No. No.

1041
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:40,842
Don't leave me.

1042
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,496
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.

1043
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:44,529
I got kids.

1044
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,580
Please! Please dont!

1045
01:16:47,643 --> 01:16:49,109
Please don't leave me!

1046
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:50,778
I ain't going anywhere!

1047
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:52,955
I'm going to get you home.
I got you Ralph.

1048
01:16:53,049 --> 01:16:54,049
Okay!

1049
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:55,692
I'm gonna get you home.

1050
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:59,228
Here's come the morphine.
Here's come the morphine.

1051
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,275
Just gonna kick it real quick, Ralph.
We gonna get you shifted.

1052
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:03,768
Stretcher!

1053
01:17:04,629 --> 01:17:06,871
Stretcher!

1054
01:17:11,395 --> 01:17:12,230
Get up!

1055
01:17:12,255 --> 01:17:13,121
Keep moving!

1056
01:17:13,184 --> 01:17:13,996
Sergeant. I'm wounded.

1057
01:17:14,058 --> 01:17:15,754
There's nothing wrong with you.

1058
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:17,902
Shit!

1059
01:17:18,003 --> 01:17:19,003
Hang on kid.

1060
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:22,331
Move!

1061
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:24,128
A soldier who doesn't is a dead one.

1062
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:28,345
You forgotten priority.

1063
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:36,505
Priority. You haven't of triage?

1064
01:17:36,579 --> 01:17:39,046
He'll be dead before we get 'em down.

1065
01:17:40,524 --> 01:17:41,524
Get him down!

1066
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:43,017
Alright!

1067
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:43,860
Huh!

1068
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1069
01:17:46,345 --> 01:17:47,345
Okay. Go!

1070
01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:50,895
It's alright buddy. We
gonna get you home.

1071
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:56,422
Medic!

1072
01:17:56,453 --> 01:17:57,920
Help! Help!

1073
01:17:58,146 --> 01:18:02,395
I figured if we can't see them and
they can't see us neither.

1074
01:18:03,248 --> 01:18:04,646
Help!

1075
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,060

1076
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:18,100
I got it Frank.

1077
01:18:28,778 --> 01:18:30,911
I think they just did smart ass!

1078
01:18:32,419 --> 01:18:33,952
Give me your hand here.

1079
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:38,017
Get down sir.

1080
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:39,761
Over there!

1081
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:40,847

1082
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:45,157

01:18:48,794 --> 01:18:49,724

01:18:49,802 --> 01:18:50,794
Dead ahead!

01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,210
Yeah. I see them too.

1086
01:18:52,248 --> 01:18:54,714
Get ready give 'em everything you got.

1087
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:57,121
I'll sent them a weapon's
team to flank them.

1088
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:05,947
Be there tight.
You gonna be right as new.

1089
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:07,426
I got it Doss.

1090
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:10,076
Got it.

1091
01:19:12,803 --> 01:19:13,803

1092
01:19:14,389 --> 01:19:15,389
Okay.

1093
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:29,091
Fire!

1094
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,409
Go!

1095
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:48,413
Son of a bitch!

1096
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:50,849
Get 'em. Get on it!

1097
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,920
- Yes sir.
- Now!

1098
01:19:58,014 --> 01:19:59,014
Smoke!

1099
01:20:02,522 --> 01:20:03,522
Corpsman.

1100
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,405
Go!

1101
01:20:11,468 --> 01:20:13,797
Go! Go! Go for it!
Get in the hole.

1102
01:20:14,485 --> 01:20:15,874
Mother...

1103
01:20:18,198 --> 01:20:19,198
Go!

1104
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,260
Be strong!

1105
01:20:28,242 --> 01:20:29,242
Cover!

1106
01:20:36,326 --> 01:20:37,326
Satchels!

1107
01:20:40,881 --> 01:20:41,868
Ghoul!

1108
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:42,884
Here!

1109
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:48,859
C'mon stick it.

1110
01:20:49,759 --> 01:20:50,759
Stick it Ghoul.

1111
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:54,329
Cover! Cover!

1112
01:21:07,456 --> 01:21:08,456
Son of a...

1113
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:20,896
Cover his ass!

1114
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:55,087
Go!

1115
01:22:39,816 --> 01:22:40,816
Medic!

1116
01:22:43,752 --> 01:22:45,819
I'm here.
Put your hand on it.

1117
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:47,554
Put your hand on it!

1118
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,420
Go! Go! Go!

1119
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:23,202
Go! Go! Go!

1120
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:35,270
Ghoul.

1121
01:23:35,622 --> 01:23:36,622
Ghoul.

1122
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:40,497
Where you hit?

1123
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:41,661
I don't know.

1124
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,377
You not hit in the
head that's okay.

1125
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:48,102
What's your name?

1126
01:23:49,047 --> 01:23:49,757
Andy.

1127
01:23:49,798 --> 01:23:50,859
Andy what?

1128
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:51,961
Andy Walker.

1129
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:53,888
Also known as?

1130
01:23:55,641 --> 01:23:56,641
- Ghoul.
- Ghoul.

1131
01:23:56,953 --> 01:23:58,718
Ghoul you're okay.
You're okay.

1132
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:04,945
Good job men.

1133
01:24:05,195 --> 01:24:06,195
Good work.

1134
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,562
Take it for the night.
We hold this spot.

1135
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,664
We mop up the rest of
the ridge tomorrow.

1136
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:12,922
Okay boys.

1137
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:15,382
Find yourself a nice safe hole.

1138
01:24:15,391 --> 01:24:16,580
End or near the bunker.

1139
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,392
We'll take watch every two hours.

1140
01:24:18,697 --> 01:24:19,830
We don't know what's out there.

1141
01:24:20,151 --> 01:24:21,751
Heads down, asses lower.

1142
01:24:21,862 --> 01:24:23,525
Shoot anything that
don't speak English.

1143
01:24:23,573 --> 01:24:24,573
That includes grease Sarge?

1144
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:25,920
Particularly him.

1145
01:24:26,506 --> 01:24:28,561
I don't care if he needed
to take a piss or a dump.

1146
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:30,506
It ain't safe to
go out there alone.

1147
01:24:32,615 --> 01:24:34,083
Where the hell you going Doss?

1148
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,211
Still more wounded out there sarge.

1149
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:38,914
I'll go with him.

1150
01:24:39,563 --> 01:24:41,496
Be smart keep your ears down.

1151
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,223
Alright let's find a spot.

1152
01:24:52,482 --> 01:24:55,416
You know Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes.

1153
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:56,651
Just straight off.

1154
01:24:58,248 --> 01:24:59,154
It's straight off.

1155
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:01,662
Peterson.

1156
01:25:01,693 --> 01:25:02,693
Popeye.

1157
01:25:03,748 --> 01:25:05,081
Stanford and Murphy.

1158
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:14,008
In peace sons bury their father.

1159
01:25:15,475 --> 01:25:17,875
In war fathers bury their sons.

1160
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,797
Wanna stop spouting that crap out?

1161
01:25:24,561 --> 01:25:25,828
It don't help none.

1162
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Yeah.

1163
01:25:29,093 --> 01:25:30,326
Yeah, you got that right.

1164
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:32,014
Not here.

1165
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:35,303
Hey.

1166
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:37,319
Give me that.

1167
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,060
Hey!

1168
01:25:45,085 --> 01:25:45,466
Hey!

1169
01:25:45,497 --> 01:25:47,758
We got an abdominal wound.

1170
01:25:48,044 --> 01:25:49,051
This lad is gonna need some plasma.

1171
01:25:49,251 --> 01:25:50,458
- You got it.
- He'll be with us.

1172
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,232
We got you.

1173
01:26:02,091 --> 01:26:03,684
Should we find a hole and dig in.

1174
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:05,791
Sounds good to me.

1175
01:26:07,169 --> 01:26:08,075
Put your helmet on.

1176
01:26:18,392 --> 01:26:19,659
You gonna eat them?

1177
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:23,572
I don't eat meat.

1178
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:24,829
Help yourself.

1179
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:27,803
Of course you don't.

1180
01:26:37,043 --> 01:26:38,776
That's one heck of a dame.

1181
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:43,152
You know you find that you
whack us with her don't you?

1182
01:26:51,037 --> 01:26:52,037
Yes, I do.

1183
01:26:53,927 --> 01:26:55,383
Don't tell her that.

1184
01:26:55,438 --> 01:26:58,031
She won't be much happy
with a man like me anyway.

1185
01:26:58,188 --> 01:26:59,812
Yeah until she got to know you.

1186
01:27:01,813 --> 01:27:03,479
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1187
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:05,367
Sometimes.

1188
01:27:09,031 --> 01:27:10,398
You're alright.

1189
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:38,443
These Japs are sneaky.

1190
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,983
I take first watch.
Now you get a shut eye.

1191
01:28:28,765 --> 01:28:29,832
Hell of a dream.

1192
01:28:48,068 --> 01:28:49,735
I dreamed I got myself killed.

1193
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,225
I can't do nothing.

1194
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,877
Rifles will just do.

1195
01:29:00,136 --> 01:29:01,136
It won't bite.

1196
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:03,761
Yeah, well.

1197
01:29:06,347 --> 01:29:07,167
Look around you.

1198
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:09,073
After what we've been through.

1199
01:29:10,103 --> 01:29:11,994
Any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

1200
01:29:12,033 --> 01:29:13,900
I never claimed to be sane.

1201
01:29:20,115 --> 01:29:21,648
My daddy's a drunk.

1202
01:29:24,197 --> 01:29:28,130
He fought it for years but it kinda got
a hold of him hard and made him mean.

1203
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:30,563
At least you know when mine could've
been with any one of the ten guys

1204
01:29:30,588 --> 01:29:32,507
And none of them
would worth a damn.

1205
01:29:34,955 --> 01:29:36,283
So your momma raise you?

1206
01:29:36,432 --> 01:29:37,150
I knew her.

1207
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:39,472
But she gave me to an
orphanage when I was five.

1208
01:29:39,698 --> 01:29:41,031
Never saw her again.

1209
01:29:43,322 --> 01:29:44,712
I know how to act quick.

1210
01:29:46,603 --> 01:29:49,439
But now I judge people quicker
and I got you very wrong.

1211
01:29:59,378 --> 01:30:01,071
My dad used to beat me
and my brother just

1212
01:30:01,096 --> 01:30:04,544
cause the sun rose and
whip us cause it sets.

1213
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,170
I could take that.

1214
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:13,078
But when he would do it to our momma.

1215
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:24,183
That's enough. No more.

1216
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:25,949
Do you hear me?

1217
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:27,611
Pull that damn trigger.

1218
01:30:27,668 --> 01:30:29,001
Don't Desmond. Stop!

1219
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:38,601
But you didn't kill 'em.

1220
01:30:41,438 --> 01:30:42,638
In my heart I did.

1221
01:31:04,922 --> 01:31:07,022
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1222
01:31:07,222 --> 01:31:09,322
I ain't never gonna touch a gun again.

1223
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:15,952
Well I ain't giving you
mine cause you're crazy.

1224
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:23,438
Move! Move!
Get your assess over there!

1225
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:24,930
- Why don't we let's go.
- Go! Go!

1226
01:32:42,782 --> 01:32:46,165
Go back! Fall back!
Go!

1227
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,253
They're coming from underground!

1228
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:06,709
Sir! Sir! This is riker six
request immediate support!

1229
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:08,913
Target is North Thirty Five One Five

1230
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,084
Don't you notice where you are?

1231
01:33:10,109 --> 01:33:14,530
Yes, I notice where the hell we are but
I don't expect to be here much longer.

1232
01:33:15,213 --> 01:33:16,829
I called an artillery strike!

1233
01:33:16,854 --> 01:33:19,673
Fall back!
Move! Move!

1234
01:33:25,723 --> 01:33:26,723
Fall back!

1235
01:33:33,463 --> 01:33:34,463
Get some!

1236
01:34:07,674 --> 01:34:08,674
Cover me!

1237
01:34:11,744 --> 01:34:12,744
Go! Go!

1238
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:19,481
Argh!

1239
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:26,561
Get out of here, kid!

1240
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:30,915
Come here, son!

1241
01:34:35,016 --> 01:34:36,349
You know what to do!

1242
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,053
Keep pressure on it!

1243
01:34:41,599 --> 01:34:43,066
No! Don't need plasma!

1244
01:34:43,161 --> 01:34:44,161
Give it to him!

1245
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:45,185
Over there!

1246
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:46,396
I'll be okay. Go!

1247
01:34:46,591 --> 01:34:47,591
Go!

1248
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:49,005
- Reece!
- What?!!!

1249
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,684
- Get on the back!
- You got it!

1250
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:52,643
Okay see you soon.

1251
01:34:57,871 --> 01:35:00,159
C'mon. C'mon!

1252
01:35:03,362 --> 01:35:05,295
We gotta move right now!
C'mon! C'mon!

1253
01:35:47,607 --> 01:35:49,592
Move! Move!

1254
01:36:33,386 --> 01:36:34,919
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1255
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:37,178

01:43:02,873 --> 01:43:06,071
Colonel. Call off the artillery attack
on Hacksaw. Couldn't pull it in.

1315
01:43:06,108 --> 01:43:08,702
There's still over a 100
men left out there.

1316
01:43:08,757 --> 01:43:11,157
Tell them to call off the
artillery on Hacksaw.

1317
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:12,998
[Radio]

Just lost our cover.

1321
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:33,455
They're starting.
We gotta move.

1322
01:43:39,675 --> 01:43:40,675
About time.

1323
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:43,376
They just keep coming.

1327
01:44:24,635 --> 01:44:25,635
Doss.

1328
01:44:27,947 --> 01:44:28,947

1329
01:44:29,635 --> 01:44:30,635
Help me.

01:44:41,598 --> 01:44:43,398
You gonna have to trust me.

01:44:43,786 --> 01:44:44,786
Take a breath.

01:45:46,396 --> 01:45:47,396
Let's go.

1334
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:52,446
Jack. You don't know if your men
out there are dead or alive.

1335
01:45:52,508 --> 01:45:54,359
We can't go back up there
without reinforcement.

1336
01:45:54,384 --> 01:45:55,501
You'll end up killing the rest.

1337
01:45:55,526 --> 01:45:56,657
So give me the reinforcement.

1338
01:45:56,682 --> 01:45:59,840
I don't have any fresh men.
I don't have any troops.

1339
01:46:00,653 --> 01:46:02,786
3 battalions got wipe out today.

1340
01:46:02,801 --> 01:46:05,074
And it'll take more than a
day to get men here.

1341
01:46:05,395 --> 01:46:07,128
I need them faster than that.

1342
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:00,387
It's okay. It's okay.

1343
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,894
It's alright. It's alright.

1344
01:48:04,365 --> 01:48:05,365
It's okay.

1345
01:48:22,768 --> 01:48:24,968
Morphine it's good.

01:49:11,002 --> 01:49:12,002
I can't see.

1353
01:49:12,101 --> 01:49:13,701
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

1354
01:49:16,187 --> 01:49:17,187
Hold still now.

1355
01:49:18,312 --> 01:49:19,312

1356
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:20,777
Hold tight.

There you go.

01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:24,123
Try that. Try that.

1359
01:49:27,203 --> 01:49:28,670

01:49:30,892 --> 01:49:31,892
Keep it down.

1362
01:49:32,056 --> 01:49:33,056
Can you walk?

1363
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:33,907
I don't know.

1364
01:49:33,931 --> 01:49:36,064
- Cause we gotta get out of here.
- Okay.

1365
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,477
Okay we got you.

Where the hell these

1382
01:51:59,524 --> 01:52:00,524
Hacksaw.

1383
01:52:00,781 --> 01:52:01,735
I thought they pulled out.

1384
01:52:02,134 --> 01:52:03,201
Not all of them.

1385
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,771
Some nuts out there drive
the wounded from the top.

1386
01:52:06,842 --> 01:52:08,436
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

1387
01:52:09,608 --> 01:52:10,381
They didn't make it.

1388
01:52:10,768 --> 01:52:12,568
Get back with you directly.

1389
01:52:13,081 --> 01:52:14,081
Easy. Easy.

Let's go.

1392
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:49,092
Get in here.

1393
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,740
There's Nips everywhere.

1394
01:52:52,727 --> 01:52:53,727
Son of a bitch.

1395
01:52:54,032 --> 01:52:55,232
Private corn stock.

1396
01:52:55,485 --> 01:52:58,152
You're nothing if not
full of surprises.

1397
01:52:58,703 --> 01:53:00,383
You want some morphine.
- Hell yes.

1398
01:53:00,408 --> 01:53:01,478
That or both.

1399
01:53:01,492 --> 01:53:02,492
Okay.

1400
01:53:03,383 --> 01:53:04,383

1401
01:53:04,867 --> 01:53:05,867
There you go.

1402
01:53:09,406 --> 01:53:10,406
Alright.

1403
01:53:10,641 --> 01:53:11,774
Easy. Let me see.

01:53:12,617 --> 01:53:15,320
How's this?
Okay. Not bad.

1405
01:53:17,461 --> 01:53:18,461
Let me see.

1406
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:20,937
I'll make much much than this.

1407
01:53:20,953 --> 01:53:22,898
But girls still won't kiss you.

1408
01:53:24,437 --> 01:53:25,437
Sarge.

1409
01:53:26,344 --> 01:53:27,773

Captain.
Something you gotta see.

1416
01:54:14,024 --> 01:54:16,446
Our guys have been coming
down in droves all night.

1417
01:54:16,471 --> 01:54:17,563
And Hollywood's here.

1418
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:18,855
I never thought I'd
see that guy again.

1419
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,364
Come on follow me.
He's right here.

1420
01:54:24,372 --> 01:54:25,839

01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:37,373

1427
01:54:37,607 --> 01:54:38,607
It's Doss.

1428
01:54:39,011 --> 01:54:40,096
Howell's still out there.

1429
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:42,297
Howell and Doss did this?

1430
01:54:43,216 --> 01:54:44,113
No, sir. It's just Doss.

1431
01:54:45,316 --> 01:54:46,737
- Just Doss?

1432
01:54:47,191 --> 01:54:49,370

01:56:08,948 --> 01:56:12,135
It's a bit late for target
practice now don't you think.

1436
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:16,479
Jump on it.

1437
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:17,689
You kidding?

1438
01:56:17,714 --> 01:56:19,247
No, I'm gonna drag you.

1439
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,702
Let's do it.

1440
01:56:28,468 --> 01:56:29,468
- Ready?
- Yeah

1441
01:56:29,749 --> 01:56:30,749
Let's go!

1442
01:56:35,362 --> 01:56:36,362
We got company.

1443
01:56:38,299 --> 01:56:39,299
Come on.

1444
01:56:59,355 --> 01:57:00,488
We're gonna jump.

1445
01:57:01,941 --> 01:57:03,073
You gotta be kidding
me, corn stock?

1446
01:57:03,098 --> 01:57:05,470
You got a bowline, not building a bra.

1447
01:57:06,824 --> 01:57:07,824
Come on!

1448
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,480
- Ready?
- Ah huh.

1449
01:57:12,519 --> 01:57:13,519
Get off!

1450
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:42,255
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sergeant.

1451
01:57:42,834 --> 01:57:43,747
Sergeant Howell.

1452
01:57:43,763 --> 01:57:45,297
Doss is still up there.

1453
01:57:47,021 --> 01:57:48,021
What the hell?

1454
01:57:48,046 --> 01:57:49,879
He's got Japs on his tail.

1455
01:58:21,608 --> 01:58:22,608
We got him.

1456
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:24,329
It's good. It's good.

1457
01:58:31,913 --> 01:58:34,303
Woah. It's okay. It's okay. Doss.

1458
01:58:35,866 --> 01:58:36,866
You're safe.

1459
01:58:37,526 --> 01:58:38,526
Okay.

1460
01:58:59,093 --> 01:59:00,093
Desmond.

1461
01:59:03,197 --> 01:59:04,197
Easy.

1462
01:59:04,869 --> 01:59:05,869
Here come on.

1463
01:59:06,119 --> 01:59:07,119
Take a seat.

1464
01:59:11,223 --> 01:59:12,290
Are you wounded?

1465
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:18,208
No.

1466
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,380
No.

1467
01:59:21,794 --> 01:59:24,528
Let's get this soldier to a
hospital tent right now.

1468
01:59:24,614 --> 01:59:25,747
Come on easy now.

1469
01:59:26,091 --> 01:59:27,091
Easy. Easy.

1470
02:00:16,193 --> 02:00:17,193
Where's Irv?

1471
02:00:17,365 --> 02:00:18,365
Irv.

1472
02:00:18,412 --> 02:00:20,224
You mean Schecter the Medic?

1473
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:21,581
He didn't make it.

1474
02:00:21,983 --> 02:00:22,849
He died of shocked.

1475
02:00:22,951 --> 02:00:23,951
No plasma.

1476
02:00:25,459 --> 02:00:26,052
Sorry.

1477
02:01:02,201 --> 02:01:03,934
All I saw was a skinny kid.

1478
02:01:03,966 --> 02:01:05,766
I didn't know who you were.

1479
02:01:10,336 --> 02:01:13,836
You done more than any other men could've
done in a service to his country.

1480
02:01:14,711 --> 02:01:17,062
I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

1481
02:01:18,906 --> 02:01:21,306
I hope one day you
could forgive me.

1482
02:01:33,692 --> 02:01:35,758
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1483
02:01:38,407 --> 02:01:41,073
I realize that tomorrow
is your Sabbath.

1484
02:01:47,288 --> 02:01:49,842
Most of these men don't
believe the same way you do.

1485
02:01:51,827 --> 02:01:53,294
They believe so much.

1486
02:01:54,387 --> 02:01:55,921
How much you believe.

1487
02:01:59,014 --> 02:02:01,710
What you did on that Ridge
is nothing short of miracle.

1488
02:02:02,085 --> 02:02:03,619
They wanna piece of it.

1489
02:02:06,656 --> 02:02:08,921
They're not gonna go
up there without you.

1490
02:02:19,858 --> 02:02:21,476
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

1491
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,969
You supposed to begin that
assault 10 minutes ago.

1492
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:25,236
We're waiting, sir.

1493
02:02:25,289 --> 02:02:26,556
Waiting for what?

1494
02:02:29,294 --> 02:02:32,161
Private Doss to finish praying for us, sir.

1495
02:02:32,194 --> 02:02:35,889
- Private Doss is praying for you.
- Who the hell is Private Doss?

1496
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:58,823
Let's go to work.

1497
02:04:51,869 --> 02:04:52,869
Down!

1498
02:04:52,894 --> 02:04:54,965
Get down! Get down on the ground!

1499
02:04:56,252 --> 02:04:57,452
On the ground now!

1500
02:05:36,879 --> 02:05:39,394
Lay down! Lay down!
I got the morphine.

1501
02:05:40,707 --> 02:05:42,863
Let's go! Let's go.
Let's get this man outta here.

1502
02:05:42,887 --> 02:05:43,887
Go! Go!

1503
02:05:48,393 --> 02:05:49,393
My Bible.

1504
02:05:49,752 --> 02:05:50,752
My Bible.

1505
02:05:52,635 --> 02:05:55,150
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1506
02:05:55,338 --> 02:05:57,697
My Bible. My Bible.

1507
02:05:58,979 --> 02:05:59,979
Okay.

1508
02:07:15,943 --> 02:07:17,476
You going home Desmond.

1509
02:07:17,982 --> 02:07:19,582
We've taken the Hacksaw.

1510
02:07:23,924 --> 02:07:25,724
Hold up! Hold up!
Desmond.

1511
02:07:28,361 --> 02:07:29,361
Desmond.

1512
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:18,481
I was praying the whole time.

1513
02:09:19,658 --> 02:09:23,853
I just start praying to the Lord
please let me get one more.

1514
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:29,069
When I got this I said "Alright
Lord please help me get one more".

1515
02:09:36,042 --> 02:09:40,370
I would say anyone is wrong to try
to compromise somebody's conviction.

1516
02:09:40,402 --> 02:09:43,335
I don't care it's the army or what it is.

1517
02:09:43,796 --> 02:09:45,612
When you're on a conviction

1518
02:09:46,187 --> 02:09:47,454
That is not a joke.

1519
02:09:49,624 --> 02:09:50,957
That's what you are.

1520
02:09:52,681 --> 02:09:56,571
Even though I said those things to him
in regard to carrying a rifle.

1521
02:09:56,728 --> 02:10:02,563
Then he would never be on my damn
side at all unless he had a rifle.

1522
02:10:03,178 --> 02:10:05,530
But then in the long run.

1523
02:10:05,928 --> 02:10:10,023
Finding out that he was one
of the bravest person alive.

1524
02:10:10,898 --> 02:10:16,031
And then to have him ended up saving my
life was the irony of the whole thing.

1525
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,105
Blood it ran down through this
fellow's face and eyes.

1526
02:10:22,302 --> 02:10:25,630
It was when that he go
in and called for medic.

1527
02:10:27,615 --> 02:10:31,415
I took the water from my
canteen and got some bandages.

1528
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:33,566
And I wash his face.

1529
02:10:34,815 --> 02:10:36,349
And when I wipe.

1530
02:10:37,034 --> 02:10:39,301
Washed up his eyes.
Eyes came out

1531
02:10:39,386 --> 02:10:42,299
Man, he just lit up.

1532
02:10:44,229 --> 02:10:46,698
He says I thought I was blind.

1533
02:10:48,461 --> 02:10:53,085
And if I hadn't got anything
more to that smile he gave me.

1534
02:10:53,548 --> 02:10:56,000
I wouldn't have been well repaid.

1535
